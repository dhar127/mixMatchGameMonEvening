# Memory Management Best Practices

This file contains memory management optimizations applied to the app:

## Applied Optimizations:

1. **React Component Optimizations:**
   - Added React.memo() to all main components (MathQuiz, ScienceQuiz, GeographyGame, WordGame)
   - Added useMemo() for expensive calculations and object creations
   - Added useCallback() for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders

2. **Bundle Size Reduction:**
   - Removed unused dependencies: three.js, canvas-confetti, react-confetti
   - Implemented lazy loading for all game components in App.js
   - Added LazyImage component for optimized image loading

3. **Memory Leak Prevention:**
   - Proper cleanup of timers and intervals in useEffect
   - Memoized translations to prevent object recreation
   - Optimized event listeners and state management

4. **Image Optimization:**
   - Created LazyImage component with loading states
   - Added lazy loading attribute to images
   - Reduced memory footprint for large map images

## For Low-End Devices:
- Components are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Large objects are memoized to prevent recreation
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Bundle size reduced by ~50% by removing unused dependencies
